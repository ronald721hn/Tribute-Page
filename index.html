          He streaked through the sport like a comet, an other-worldly superstar
          whose brilliance as a driver was matched by a dazzling intellect and
          coruscating charisma that illuminated Formula One racing as never
          before. No one tried harder or pushed himself further, nor did anyone
          shed so much light on the extremes to which only the greatest drivers
          go. Intensely introspective and passionate in the extreme, Ayrton
          Senna endlessly sought to extend his limits, to go faster than
          himself, a quest that ultimately made him a martyr but did not
          diminish his mystique.

        <div class="text parbase">
          <p>
            Ayrton Senna da Silva was born on March 21, 1960, into a wealthy
            Brazilian family where, with his brother and sister, he enjoyed a
            privileged upbringing. He never needed to race for money but his
            deep need for racing began with an infatuation for a miniature
            go-kart his father gave him when he was four years old. As a boy the
            highlights of Ayrton's life were Grand Prix mornings when he awoke
            trembling with anticipation at the prospect of watching his Formula
            One heroes in action on television. At 13 he raced a kart for the
            first time and immediately won. Eight years later he went
            single-seater racing in Britain, where in three years he won five
            championships, by which time he had divorced his young wife and
            forsaken a future in his father's businesses in favour of pursuing
            success in Formula One racing, where he made his debut with Toleman
            in 1984. At Monaco (a race he would win six times), his sensational
            second to Alain Prost's McLaren - in torrential rain - was
            confirmation of the phenomenal talent that would take the sport by
            storm.

            Deciding Toleman's limited resources were inadequate for his
            towering ambition, Senna bought out his contract and in 1985 moved
            to Lotus, where in three seasons he started from pole 16 times (he
            eventually won a record 65) and won six races. Having reached the
            limits of Lotus he decided the fastest way forward would be with
            McLaren, where he went in 1988 and stayed for six seasons, winning
            35 races and three world championships.

          <p>
            In 1988, when McLaren-Honda won 15 of the 16 races, Senna beat his
            team mate Alain Prost eight wins to seven to take his first driving
            title. Thereafter two of the greatest drivers became protagonists in
            one of the most infamous feuds. In 1989 Prost took the title by
            taking Senna out at the Suzuka chicane. In 1990 Senna extracted
            revenge at Suzuka's first corner, winning his second championship by
            taking out Prost's Ferrari at Suzuka's first corner. Senna's third
            title, in 1991, was straightforward as his domination as a driver
            became even more pronounced, as did his obsession with becoming
            better still. Some of his greatest performances came in his final
            year with McLaren, following which he moved to Williams for the
            ill-fated 1994 season.

            Beyond his driving genius Senna was one of the sport's most
            compelling personalities. Though slight in stature he possessed a
            powerful physical presence, and when he spoke, with his warm brown
            eyes sparkling and his voice quavering with intensity, his eloquence
            was spellbinding. Even the most jaded members of the Formula One
            fraternity were mesmerised by his passionate soliloquies and in his
            press conferences you could hear a pin drop as he spoke with such
            hypnotic effect. His command performances were captured by the media
            and the world at large became aware of Senna's magnetic appeal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone marvelled at how he put so much of himself, his very soul,
            into everything he did, not just his driving but into life itself.
            Behind the wheel the depth of his commitment was there for all to
            see and the thrilling spectacle of Senna on an all-out qualifying
            lap or a relentless charge through the field evoked an uneasy
            combination of both admiration for his superlative skill and fear
            for his future.

        </div>
        <div class="text parbase">
          <p>
            He drove like a man possessed - some thought by demons. His ruthless
            ambition provoked condemnation from critics, among them Prost who
            accused him of caring more about winning than living. When Senna
            revealed he had discovered religion Prost and others suggested he
            was a dangerous madman who thought God was his co-pilot. "Senna is a
            genius," Martin Brundle said. "I define genius as just the right
            side of imbalance. He is so highly developed to the point that he's
            almost over the edge. It's a close call."
          </p>

          <p>
            Even Senna confessed he occasionally went too far, as was the case
            in qualifying for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, where he became a
            passenger on a surreal ride into the unknown. Already on pole, he
            went faster and faster and was eventually over two seconds quicker
            than Prost in an identical McLaren. "Suddenly, it frightened me,"
            Ayrton said, "because I realised I was well beyond my conscious
            understanding. I drove back slowly to the pits and did not go out
            anymore that day."

            He said he was acutely aware of his own mortality and used fear to
            control the extent of the boundaries he felt compelled to explore.
            Indeed, he regarded racing as a metaphor for life and he used
            driving as a means of self-discovery. "For me, this research is
            fascinating. Every time I push, I find something more, again and
            again. But there is a contradiction. The same moment that you become
            the fastest, you are enormously fragile. Because in a split-second,
            it can be gone. All of it. These two extremes contribute to knowing
            yourself, deeper and deeper."
          </p>

          <p>
            His self-absorption did not preclude deep feelings for humanity and
            he despaired over the world's ills. He loved children and gave
            millions of his personal fortune (estimated at $400 million when he
            died) to help provide a better future for the underprivileged in
            Brazil. Early in 1994 he spoke about his own future. "I want to live
            fully, very intensely. I would never want to live partially,
            suffering from illness or injury. If I ever happen to have an
            accident that eventually costs my life, I hope it happens in one
            instant."

            And so it did, on May 1, 1994, in the San Marino Grand Prix, where
            his race-leading Williams inexplicably speared off the Imola track
            and hit the concrete wall at Tamburello corner. Millions saw it
            happen on television, the world mourned his passing and his state
            funeral in Sao Paulo was attended by many members of the shocked
            Formula One community. Among the several drivers escorting the
            coffin was Alain Prost. Among the sad mourners was Frank Williams,
            who said: "Ayrton was no ordinary person. He was actually a greater
            man out of the car than in it."
