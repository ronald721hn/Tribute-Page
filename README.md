For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.
The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

These skills will be needed for this project:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
